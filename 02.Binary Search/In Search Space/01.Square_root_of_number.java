QUESTION:
Given an integer x, find the square root of x. If x is not a perfect square, then return floor(√x).

Example:

Input:
x = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Since 5 is not a perfect square, the floor of the square root of 5 is 2.

Input:
x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: Since 4 is a perfect square, the square root of 4 is 2.

APPROACH:
We can use binary search to find the square root of x. 
1. Initialize the search space with low = 1 and high = x.
2. While low is less than or equal to high:
     - Calculate the mid of the search space.
     - If the square of mid is equal to x, return mid as the square root.
     - If the square of mid is less than x, update the answer to mid and set low = mid + 1 to search for a larger value.
     - If the square of mid is greater than x, set high = mid - 1 to search for a smaller value.
3. Return the answer, which represents the floor of the square root of x.

// CODE:-

    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        if (x == 0 || x == 1) return x;
        long low = 1, high = x, ans = 1;
        while (low <= high) {
            long mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (mid * mid <= x) {
                ans = mid;
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return (int) ans;
    }
