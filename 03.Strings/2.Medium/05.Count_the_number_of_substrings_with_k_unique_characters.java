/*Given a string of lowercase alphabets, count all possible substrings (not necessarily distinct) that have exactly k distinct characters. 

Example 1:

Input:
S = "aba", K = 2
Output:
3
Explanation:
The substrings are:
"ab", "ba" and "aba".

Example 2:

Input: 
S = "abaaca", K = 1
Output:
7
Explanation:
The substrings are:
"a", "b", "a", "aa", "a", "c", "a". 

Approach:
1. We can solve this problem using the sliding window technique.
2. Initialize a variable ans to keep track of the count of substrings with exactly k distinct characters.
3. Create an unordered_map mp to store the count of characters in the current window.
4. Initialize two pointers i and j to mark the start and end of the window, both initially pointing to the start of the string.
5. Iterate j from the start to the end of the string:
   - Increment the count of the current character s[j] in mp.
   - If the number of distinct characters in mp exceeds k, move the start pointer i towards the right until the number of distinct characters becomes k again.
   - Update the ans by adding the length of the current window (j - i + 1) to it.
6. Return the value of ans.

            while (distinct > k) {
                if (--freq[s.charAt(left) - 'a'] == 0) distinct--;
                left++;
            }
            count += (right - left + 1);
